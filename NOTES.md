# MyTube


## Obscure YouTube details

Metadata of videos in RSS feed that can change:
- title
- description
- date of publication

The date got me by surprise. Happened to a live stream. It initially had a date of publication of a month ago, and then it changed to a few hours ago.


## Dependencies

SQLite version >= 3.24.0, because MyTube uses upsert.
